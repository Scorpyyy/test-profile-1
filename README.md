# test-proj1
i'm practicing my coding while creating my portfolio
//learningshit!!! 

heres the demo of what im working on -- [Github ->](https://scorpyyy.github.io/test-proj1/)





    |BASH| 
        you can do the first "git pull origin --rebase" on bash
        and the second one is "git pull origin main" on bash again


    |Prefer|
        but if you prefer the basic just do a "git pull origin main"

    |Need Pull Req|
        but if the vsc is requesting for pull u can do a "git pull origin --rebase" 
                                                                -then "git pull origin main" on bash again



-thankyou.
